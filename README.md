1. Handle bootstrapping for KNN regression.

2. Load Task1B_train.csv and Task1B_test.csv sets. Apply your bootstrapping for KNN regression with times = 50 (the number of subsets), size = 20 (the size of each subset), and change K=1,.., 15 (the neighbourhood size). Now create a boxplot where the x-axis is K, and the y-axis is the average error (and the uncertainty around it) corresponding to each K.

3. Load Task1B_train.csv and Task1B_test.csv sets. Apply your bootstrapping for KNN regression with K= 5(the neighbourhood size), times = 50 (the number of subsets), and change sizes = 5, 10, 15,..., 75 (the size of each subset). Now create a boxplot where the x-axis is ‘sizes’ and the y-axis is the average error (and the uncertainty around it) corresponding to each value of ‘times’.
